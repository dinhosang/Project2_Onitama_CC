# Onitama App

An application based on the Onitama board game (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160477/onitama).

A fuller description may be found through the above link, but to describe it quickly it is a chess-like game where each piece has access to the same moves, and the moves available to a player's piece are randomly determined each game, and change with each turn.

## Reason for selection

Android was something we only had four days of lessons on so I wished to practice it further to solidify my understanding.

The topic of the app itself was something that interested me, and something I had played very often in real life. This meant I would not have to spend time learning how the game works, and could instead concentrate trying to put it into practice in an Android app.

## Tools used

* Java for game logic
* Android for UI
* Shared preferences for data storage

* Camera for taking game images
* GIMP image editor for re-working game images
