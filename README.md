# Onitama App

An application based on the Onitama board game (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160477/onitama).

A fuller description may be found through the above link, but to describe it quickly it is a chess-like game where each piece has access to the same moves, and the moves available to a player's piece are randomly determined each game, and change with each turn.

## Reason for selection

Android was something we only had four days of lessons on so I wished to practice it further to solidify my understanding. The topic of the app itself is something that interests me and something I have played very often in real life, meaning I would not have to spend too much time learning how the game works, and could instead spend as much time as possible trying to put it into practice in an Android app.
